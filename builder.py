""" Example Problem when to use factory desing pattern """

# Imagine you want to join one of the elite batches of GeeksforGeeks. So, you will go there and ask about the 
# Fee structure, timings available, and batches about the course you want to join. After looking at the system, 
# they will tell you about the courses, their Fee structures, timings available and batches. Thatâ€™s it! 
# (No! we are not done yet because we are good developers).Our main purpose is to design the system flexible, 
# reliable, organized and lubricative. what Unexperienced developers will do is that they will create a separate
# and unique class for each and every course provided by GeeksforGeeks. Then they will create separate object 
# instantiation for each and every class although which is not required every time. The main problem will arise 
# when GeeksforGeeks will start new courses and developers have to add new classes as well because their code is 
# not much flexible.

""" Pros """

# 1. Reusability: While making the various representations of the products, we can use the same construction 
#    code for other representations as well.
# 2. Single Responsibility Principle: We can separate out both the business logic
#    as well as the complex construction code from each other.
# 3. Construction of the object: Here we construct our object step by step, defer construction steps or run 
#    steps recursively.
